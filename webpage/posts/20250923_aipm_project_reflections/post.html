    <h2>Context &amp; Objectives</h2>
<p>We recently completed an initial findings report for the <a href="https://jc-cr.com/#post/20250915_development_of_an_agentic_ai_system_for_project_planning_and_management_in_a_digital_collaborative_environment">AIPM project</a>, a study to see if an agentic project manager could outperform humans for directing human workers. </p>
<p>Although we met the deadline for initial paper submissions to the <a href="https://cisummit-crc.asce.org/">CRC conference</a>, there were many internal milestones that our team failed to meet as well as key targets from our originally drafted Project Requirements Doc.</p>
<h2>What Went Well</h2>
<ul>
<li>Met paper submission deadline</li>
<li>Created a functional AI PM framework that received real-time Minecraft data</li>
<li>Completed a functional Build Mart replica for evaluating project management capabilities in Minecraft</li>
<li>Completed a pilot study to gather comparison data between different human management methods</li>
<li>Managed to adapt to asynchronous workflow</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Didn't Go Well</h2>
<ul>
<li>Began to fall behind around June (aligning with summer activities and travel)</li>
<li>Online live collaboration meetings were frequently not attended</li>
<li>Planned larger human study fell through due to scheduling issues and difficulty accessing UTSA training platform remotely</li>
<li>I ended up doing more low-level work than I expected, likely due to failure in my task delegation to other members</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Although live collaboration was a good plan, should have also made better use of issues and a digital kanban board for clearer task assignment and planning. This would have helped to better communicate big picture to team</li>
<li>Documentation started to lag as development pace increased, this could be remedied by not overburdening individual contributors (IC)</li>
<li>Better experiment and testing protocols should have been made to make better use of testing time before live study</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions for Next Time</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implement a digital kanban system (move to Gitlab if we can't on Github)</li>
<li>Make sure to actively update <a href="https://www.lean.org/downloads/LPPD_ConceptPaper-04-17.pdf">Concept Paper</a></li>
<li>Keep steady 60-80% workload for all developers. This varies by IC so ensure you know the IC's schedule and capabilities</li>
</ul>
