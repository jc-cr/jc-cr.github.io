    <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This thesis presents the design, development, and analysis of the Human Aware Andon Module (HAAM), a low-cost, energy-efficient edge machine learning system for enhancing safety in human-robot interactions in manufacturing and industrial environments.<br />
The system integrates a Coral Dev Board Micro with an Edge TPU, a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor, and RGB LEDs to detect humans, estimate distances, and visually signal robot states.<br />
A novel depth estimation algorithm is developed that aligns low-resolution ToF data with RGB camera input. <br />
Using the aligned depth data and detection bounding boxes, a weighted cell-based distance calculation is used to provide a distance estimate for each human detection in a scene.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the configurability of the HAAM system through integration testing with a UR5e robot in a pick-and-place scenario.<br />
Testing showed successful speed modulation and emergency stopping with response times under 10ms, providing real-world validation of the system's capabilities as a practical safety solution. <br />
The HAAM system offers significant advantages in cost (\$104), power efficiency (1.27W), and visual signaling capabilities compared to commercial alternatives, demonstrating the potential of edge machine learning for enhancing workplace safety through visual feedback of machine states. More so, the small form factor and low power requirements allow for the HAAM to be easily attached to a variety of robot platforms.</p>
