<p>These are my logs for my trip to Ohio. The route was from San Antonio, TX to Dayton, OH. The image below is pretty much the route I took over this 6 day trip.</p>

<p>San Antonio, TX -&gt; Austin, TX</p>
<p>Today I traveled from SA to Austin. It was my venture over an hour, pretty tough. <br/>
I took the Texas highways to avoid driving on I35. <br/>
Left at 1000 and arrived at destination at 1530. <br/>
Made 2 gas station stops along the way. </p>
<p>The worst part of trip was driving in Austin and Round Rock. Too much traffic!</p>
<p>211 route was beautiful. Lots of greenery and twists on road, limestone hills all around. Really pleasent. Towards Blanco I noticed the terrain became less rocky.</p>
<p>The Colorado river was  great view in Austin. </p>
<p>I was really hot when wearing my full gear. My legs started getting sore around half way in. My second gas station stop i noticed my hands were numb from the shaking!</p>
<p>Super important to drink a lot of water early in the morning or night before. First piss should be clear as my old soccer coach used to tell us.</p>

<p>Traveled from Bartlett, TX to Lone Start, TX today. Departed around 1200, arived around 1930.<br/>
Ended up taking all the state highways instead of interstate. Was happy with this decision as there was little traffic, I got to drive fast (80), fun roads with curves, and got to see beautiful scenery -- from rolling corn fields to lakes and large pineywood trees.</p>
<p>Note to self though. Leave ample time to reserve a hotel. It was getting dark so I just booked what I could find that was 30 minutes away from the gas station I was at. </p>
<p>I didn't make it to Texarkana as I planned. This means I probably can't make it to Memphis tomorrow. Most likely just to Little Rock. </p>

<p>Lone star, TX (1000) -&gt; Pine Bluff, AR (1630)</p>
<p>Great ride. Nice highways in AR with little traffic. Large trees . Passed at least 2 rivers -- one was the red river.<br/>
I think this is a good amount of mileage. Could have done more though, thought there would be more traffic out here around 1700.</p>

<p>Pine Bluff, AR (1000) -&gt; Cape Girardeau, MO</p>
<p>Another nice ride. The state highways are great. Little traffic and great views.<br/>
There was a storm on my way to MO so I stopped at a Subway for a bit. Talked to a nice girl who attended University of Michigan and studied criminal law. It's nice to be able to talk with people and hear their stories. All life, just a distributed experience of human actors interacting with the world, pushing it's boundaries towards evolution. The invisible hand of the market and the invisible hand of evolution. What is it even pushing us to? </p>
<p>Missouri is gorgeous. The land is green and beautiful. Rolling hills, picturesque farms. It looks well kept and uniform. <br/>
Surprised by the nice downtown area of Cape Girardeau. It is right next to Mississippi river and has a bunch of local businesses and restaurants. </p>

<p>Cape Girardeau, MO -&gt; Vincenness, ID</p>
<p>Shorter trip today since I had a meeting at 1200. Beautiful ride though. Weather was great. Sunny and 70ish. The roads here are nice. Not a lot of traffic but all single lanes so one slow driver can cause a clot. I really don't like passing cars as I don't really have a good vantage point for oncoming cars and my bike isn't really made for speed.</p>
<p>30 minutes from my destination I fell when entering a gas station. Thankfully someone helped me pick up the bike. The tip of my brake lever snapped off and I somehow hurt my left wrist. That experience really shook me up -- not sure why. It was embarrassing, but I think it broke my spirits somehow. After so many hours enjoying the beautiful roads, the rest of the ride I was gloomy and tired.  </p>

<p>Vincenness, ID -&gt; Dayton, OH</p>
<p>Long trip. Arrived tired and beat. Ate at a nice Italian restaurant when I arrived though. Hit patches of rain in the middle of my trip. Thankfully I was in a town by then and could stop at Taco Bell for an hour. Oh and it was really cold the entire trip. Like 45-50. Kind of sucked. But I have learned to embrace the suck. </p>
<h2>Post trip reflections</h2>
<p>By far the most notable stop of my journey was at Cape Girardeau. Loved the downtown area and spending time by the river. <br/>
On trip back I need to plan my stays better. Choose locations with interesting things to see.  I think getting a hotel room in the morning gave me the best prices, but this requires you identify the location the night before.</p>
<p>State highways are great. Being able to stop at gas stations frequently as you enter a town is extremely convenient. I found myself stopping every 30 minutes or so to top off the gas tank. My bike needs 95 octane (or something like that) -- the premium stuff. Some gas stations along the way did not have that, so it's best to get it whenever you can. Drink lots of liquid the night before and early in the morning.</p>
<p>My bike is surprisingly comfortable. I only really got saddle-sore at the end of a longer trip. Shifting leg position helps out.</p>
<p>Oh and take more pictures! I kind of wish I had been recording the trip. The scenery was beautiful and would be best captured through video. It's also hard to pull over on some of the highways because there is no shoulder. </p>
<p>I noticed all the rivers and creeks I drove past on my trip were pretty murky. Maybe because of the rain this week. It makes realize how I took for granted the clear spring-fed rivers of Central Texas.</p>
