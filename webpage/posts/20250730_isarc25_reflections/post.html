<h2>My Presentation</h2>
<p>My presentation went well. They recorded so hopefully the videos get posted soon.<br/>
Had a few questions regarding system details and further human-studies which was nice. </p>
<h2>Notable Presentations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Challenges in additive construction by extrusion of concrete, need for in place quality sensing (group from TAMU)</li>
<li>Scene graph safety matching and VR testing </li>
<li>6 cable driven robot for sidewall </li>
<li>block chain for smart contract in construction apps</li>
<li>entropy calculations for forecasting what areas need more manager attention: https://www.iaarc.org/publications/2025_proceedings_of_the_42nd_isarc_montreal_canada/fuzzy-chaos_framework_for_analyzing_and_quantifying_uncertainty_in_labour_productivity_in_complex_construction_environments.html</li>
<li>Best paper: GPR-former an interesting approach to automated rooftop water damage assessment using positionally encoded dataset for roof data.</li>
<li>A Canadian Construction Automation and Robotics Roadmap Carl - Haas</li>
<li>Advancing Construction Research Through Strategic Industry-Academic Partnerships - Simaan AbouRizk</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Well organized but long conference, usually pretty tired by 1600 with all the interesting presentations.</li>
<li>This conference covers a breadth of topics. Some that interested me were the additive printing cases with clay and cement, the use of AI enabled robots, and some intelligent planning works. </li>
<li>I think what made the best paper impact is that it was done by a company, built off of previous research directly, had good thought process in the innovation, and gave some direct results from evaluation that incorporate real-world application. Seemed like a work that could be published in multiple venues as well like IROS. </li>
<li>But overall I think I still need to learn some more to make a better assessment. The conferences I've gone to so far in my career have just been figuring out what to do and how to make the most out of these experience; also I've just been getting a feel for what is being researched at the moment in this domain.</li>
<li>I liked Wednesday morning talk. Better metric for evaluating researchers than just published papers: "What is your impact?". Goes beyond publishing, it assess project you've worked on, communities you have helped, etc. So it's important to be able to have good metrics personally for being able to gauge what you've done and how you have helped the world beyond just publications.</li>
</ul>
