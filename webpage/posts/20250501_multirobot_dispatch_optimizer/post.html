    <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This report presents a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach for optimizing multi-robot inspection planning in outdoor construction environments. <br />
Motivated by the growing use of precast concrete elements requiring efficient inspection methods, the research develops a coordinated system where aerial robots rapidly locate inspection targets while ground robots perform detailed inspections. <br />
The mathematical model maximizes inspection coverage while respecting constraints including robot speed, battery endurance, and operational precedence requirements. <br />
Analysis revealed that ground robot quantity and aerial robot endurance were the most influential parameters, while inspection time had negligible impact on performance. <br />
The formulation was implemented in Python using PuLP with an interactive browser-based visualization interface. <br />
Computational performance testing showed non-monotonic scaling behavior with map size and waypoint count. </p>
