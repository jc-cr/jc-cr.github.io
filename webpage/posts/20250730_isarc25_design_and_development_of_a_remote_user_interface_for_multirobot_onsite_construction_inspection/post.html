    <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper presents the design and development of an open-source browser-based interface for coordinating a multi-robot system for on-site construction inspections. The developed system enables remote human operators to effectively oversee and direct automated inspection tasks using both aerial and ground-based robotic platforms. The interface incorporates gaze-tracking technology for intuitive target selection and implements a containerized microservice architecture to ensure reliable deployment across different operating environments. The complete system architecture, implementation methodology, and a real-world inspection scenario are presented. The application has been released as open-source software to encourage adoption and further development by the construction automation community.</p>
