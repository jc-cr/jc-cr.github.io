<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For senior design 2, our group completed the working prototype for the General Electronic Module Tester (GEMT).</p>
<p>The GEMT included a custom shield and 3D printed case for the Arduino Mega board, as well as a custom library for testing common IoT modules.</p>
<p>Below is an image of one of the earlier prototypes (sorry couldn't find a better picture at the time of writing this post).</p>

<p>I lead the software development for the library architecture, test menu, and test program for the nRF24 module.</p>
