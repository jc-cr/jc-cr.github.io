    <h2>Trip Summary</h2>
<p>In this trip I traveled around the Buenos Aires area on a Honda GLH 150cc. <br />
Below is the route I took and a detailed travel log.</p>

<h2>Travel Log</h2>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>Arrived in Buenos Aires around 1000 Dec 15. I was in line for around 1 hour to get past immigration.<br />
At the airport I exchanged 100 USD to pesos - a good decisions since taxi only accepted cash.<br />
I then spent about 30 minutes trying to find somewhere to purchase a local sim at. Finally I found the place and loaded it with funds (10000 ARP got me 12 Gb).</p>
<p>Finally left airport around 1230 in a taxi. Arrived at motorcycle rental place at 1330. Signed everything and had my moto ready to go, but I forgot to buy an outlet adapter and my phone was at around 30%, so I stuck around a bit to charge it.<br />
With 40% battery, I departed and went to look for the nearest gas station. In Argentina they call it "nafta" and generally there is an attendant there to fill it up for you.<br />
After filling up on nafta, I then drove about 30 minutes to get to my hotel. On the map the hotel seems pretty close but with all the traffic and one way street flow, it took longer than expected. </p>
<p>Traffic in Buenos Aires is tough but manageable. The car drivers aren't super aggressive or fast, and the motos are also pretty calm. One does have to be always aware though since lanes suddenly narrow when big trucks are unloading or if there's construction.<br />
Here a red light will turn yellow before it turns green. It's a good indicator to rev up the engine on the bike.</p>
<p>After settling down in my hotel, I then went to look for the adapter and a power bank. Back home my moto has a usb connection plug for charging my phone while riding, here I figured a power bank would be the most convenient way to make sure the phone stayed powered.<br />
I walked around the Plaza de Congreso, went and bought my things, and then organized my belongings for the next day ride. <br />
I ate at a restaurant across from the hotel. All the restaurants seem to serve you some bread to start off. I ate a Milanesa accompanied by 1 L of beer.</p>
<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>I left Buenos Aires towards San Miguel del Monte on my second day of the trip. The traffic in Buenos Aires is heavy but manageable. Cars don't really respect the lane lines here - neither do motos. On a moto one can get around much faster than a car here though since you can lane split.<br />
That was something that I needed to do often but don't really feel comfortable with since it's not allowed back in Texas.</p>
<p>On my way out of the city I was cruising down a street and almost ran past a light that had turned red. I had to do a hard brake and my moto began to swerve and lose traction. A scary experience but I did all the right things and stopped in time without passing the light.</p>
<p>Leaving the city was great. Light highway traffic and much faster speeds. The max speed seemed to be 110 kph, however my moto (a Honda GLH 150cc) could only reach about 100 kph max. </p>
<p>I made a pit stop in San Vicente for gas then kept riding on to San Miguel.<br />
San Miguel is a nice town near some lakes. The water there is very brown so not good for swimming, but it does make the surrounding area cool and peaceful.</p>
<p>I walked around the lake and visited a museum, "Rancho de Juan Manuel de Rosas", which was some kind of historical barn that was moved from rural location to the town in 1987. One really cool thing I learned is that Charles Darwin met with de Rosas near the town by accident when he was aboard some expedition as a student. The town has an honorary plaque for him.</p>

<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p>The next day I left for San Antonio de Areco. The ride was smooth. I saw the Argentinian countryside with it's beautiful cedar trees, flat landscape, vibrant purple flowers, and many cows. <br />
I made a pit stop in San Andres de Giles to eat a sandwich and get gas. </p>
<p>I arrived to my hotel in SA de Areco and started planning what to do next. I found out that the Gaucho museum I wanted to visit was closed that day. So I just walked around town and hung out at the park. </p>
<p>SA de Areco was also a very nice town. The layout reminded me of mexican plazas with the brick roads and intersections all around. Not fun to ride in since there are no stops or lights. It's nice if you're walking though!<br />
There's a river which runs north of the town and has an adjacent park and swimming area. </p>
<p>One thing I noticed about Argentina is that people really like the outdoors. At anytime of the day I would see people picnicking and drinking mate in the park. </p>

<h3>Day 4</h3>
<p>The next day I headed for northern Buenos Aires towards San Isidro. <br />
Upon leaving the hotel I found out my moto had the right handle bar angled inwards. I'm not really sure what happened but it seems like someone parked next to me at the hotel and knocked over the bike, then picked it up and put it back in place. <br />
There wasn't much I could do at that point so I just went on my way.</p>
<p>Driving the moto with a crooked handlebar was uncomfortable but doable. For whatever reason it also seemed to increase my speed where before I was maxing out at 90 kph, I could now hit 100 kph (other things like wind and road probably made more of a difference though...)!<br />
I made it San Isidro without issue though, pushing my way through the wrist pain, heat, and stress from all the traffic.</p>
<p>San Isidro is a very nice part of Buenos Aires. It feels more suburban than the CABA, but is still dense with large houses and buildings. The houses seem to be some colonial style villas with a walled exterior and an inner garden area. </p>
<p>Walking around the city I saw a nice church and garden area. I also ate at a Burger King.<br />
In the evening there was classical concert going on in front of the church. </p>

<h3>Rest of trip</h3>
<p>The next day I drove back to the Almagro area where I stayed for a few nights to prep to return the moto. <br />
Along the way I stopped by some local parks to see the Atlantic ocean, a nice lake and a bunch of statues (including one of George Washington).</p>
<p>I walked all around the city and got to see a Japanese garden area and the Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires. <br />
At the art museum I followed the guidance of Javier Sierra and focused on a single painting to study. The painting I chose was "Baile en Tehuantepec" by Diego Rivera. I read the article about the painting before viewing it and then stood in front of the painting for about an hour.<br />
One interesting detail I noticed is that there is a lot of blackness behind the man with the orange shirt that seems out of place. In addition, the blue banner above that man randomly stops and the connecting line is not seen. If you look at the line parallel to it though, you can see that those banners do have a full line. The perspective there is very odd and I couldn't wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>On the way back I ate an incredible Panini.</p>
<p>The following day I went to a hotel in Canning near the EZE airport and left back home the next day.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Traveling in South America on a motorcycle was something I had on my life's bucket list after reading "Diarios de Motocicleta" by Che Guevara. <br />
I didn't get to explore as much as he did, but I did get a taste and a taste is enough to see if you like something or not. <br />
And enjoy it I did!</p>
<p>One thing I have not gotten better at though is planning my daily itinerary beyond the motorcycle rides. The part I enjoy most about my personal trips on a motorcycle is the journey itself.<br />
Riding a motorcycle puts me in a flow state where I am completely immersed in the moment. <br />
Since nothing can really beat that flow state for me, the rest of what I do in the day I just figure when I arrive to the destination.</p>
<p>It's nice being alone in a Latin American country too because it shows me how weak my Spanish speaking skills are. Sure, I have enough skill to handle common interactions easily, but I really wanted to be able to communicate more naturally with people and socialize a bit. It's hard enough for me as an introvert to go out and chat people up, but not having a strong hold of the language makes it even harder since I'll stand out so much.<br />
Part of the issue has to due with dialect as well. The Argentinian dialect is pretty different from my Mexican one, so even in normal interactions I already stood out with things like not using "vos" and not having the "sh" accent they do. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the experience was fun and I'd definitely like to come back and explore even more of the country.</p>
