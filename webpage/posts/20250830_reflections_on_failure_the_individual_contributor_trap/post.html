<p>I have lots of experience failing on projects. <br/>
For the past few years I have managed/overseen many robotics projects through UTSA's RAS chapter; all of these projects failed in one way or another, but the most common failure mode was from missed deadlines.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it wasn't until earlier this year that I learned the value of documenting reflection through <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/toyotas-secret-the-a3-report/">A3 reports </a>, so I don't have documentation or stats to go off of for this analysis. <br/>
Reflecting on my experience though, I'd say the greatest contributor to these failures was letting our project managers (including myself) fall into the Individual Contributor Trap (IC Trap).<br/>
This <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/avoid-individual-contributor-trap-4-tips-new-people-leaders-guilford-jomnc">article</a> defines the IC Trap - basically the IC Trap is when someone in a management position fails to spend their time managing and instead spends their time doing the work themselves. </p>
<p>Why is the IC Trap a problem?<br/>
Well a good manager should have a clear understanding of the project's progress, every project member's availability and bandwidth for the project, and a strategy of how to get the right people to do the right work.<br/>
This planning and strategizing takes up a significant amount of time and brainpower, but it's also a continuous process.<br/>
Plans need to be adaptive.<br/>
When a manager stops devoting time to these management tasks, plans soon become outdated and worse than useless.<br/>
The outdated information could take a negative toll on your team's understanding of the project's current state and will require a growing amount of effort to correct as you let it decay.</p>
<p>So when a person in a management position instead dedicates their time and energy to doing task level work, the planning falls behind and members start getting out of sync.<br/>
This is especially bad at the club level since we face some unique challenges:<br/>
- We have very little money so we can't pay people. Any time devoted to club activities is voluntary<br/>
- Very high turnover rate for members<br/>
- High variability in new member joining rates and periods. Get large batches of new people, as well as random people joining throughout the semester.</p>
<p>So once the management stuff starts falling behind it affects the project in very crucial ways; all the training starts to get outdated, new members become discouraged because they can't figure out how to help, old members feel discouraged because they don't have any help to complete tasks and feel like they're not doing enough, and managers stress out because the project starts to fall behind.</p>
<p>But why do we fall into the IC trap in the first place?<br/>
Two things I think (From my experience): a manager's desire to continue doing technical tasks and a manager's desire to see the project progress.</p>
<p>For the former case it makes sense that someone in a school club would want to gain actual technical experience - club projects offer a low risk, high reward way to do so.<br/>
In fact, that's the reason I joined the club in the first place.<br/>
As a student trying to get a job at some point, it was in my best interest to actually work  on projects and improve my skills. </p>
<p>For the latter case, I think this just comes from lack of management experience. <br/>
A motivated and well directed team can get a lot done.<br/>
Getting a team motivated and providing direction is not easy though.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I never quite figured out how to solve the IC Trap problem.<br/>
I think one way to potentially solve it would be to let more experienced people manage the project. <br/>
Possibly graduate students or professors who don't rely so much on the task completions to bolster their own experience, but instead can dedicate more time to the actual management tasks.</p>
