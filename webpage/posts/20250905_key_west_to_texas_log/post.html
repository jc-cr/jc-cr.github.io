<h2>Trip Summary</h2>
<p>The first part of my trip took me from Ohio to Key West, Florida. <br/>
See <a href="https://jc-cr.com/#post/20250828_ohio_to_key_west_travel_log">Ohio to Key West Travel Log</a>.<br/>
Recently I completed the last part of my trip to get back to Texas.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown:<br/>
- Key west -&gt; Miami<br/>
- Miami -&gt; Sarasota<br/>
- Sarasota -&gt; Ocala<br/>
- Ocala -&gt; Panama City<br/>
- Panama City -&gt; Mobile<br/>
- Mobile -&gt; Eunice<br/>
- Eunice -&gt; Georgetown-ish</p>
<p>About 1596 miles total.<br/>
Averaging about 228 miles per day!</p>
<p>Didn't do much those days other than drive, eat, and spend my evenings working a research project I need to submit soon.</p>
<p>I did pick up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Two_Worlds:_The_Marquis_de_Lafayette_in_the_Age_of_Revolution">Mike Duncan's 'Hero of Two Worlds'</a> in Panama City. <br/>
I've been a big fan of his podcast's and have been meaning to read this book.<br/>
So far it's been a really great read. </p>
<p>I recently found out that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Chubbuck">"first person to die by suicide on a live television broadcast"</a> did it in Sarasota, Florida!<br/>
And she was from Ohio, the state I was just returning from.<br/>
What a coincidence!</p>
<p>The drive from Panama City to Mobile was really nice. <br/>
I crossed various bridges going over the large bodies of water.</p>
<p>Here's a route map:</p>
