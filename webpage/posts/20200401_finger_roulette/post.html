    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>For one of my electrical engineering classes I designed this "Finger Roulette" game. The letters of UTSA are each a capacitance sensor. Each round a letter is randomly selected which would initiate a chopping action with a stepper motor, the other three letters would simply light a green LED and display a happy message. </p>
