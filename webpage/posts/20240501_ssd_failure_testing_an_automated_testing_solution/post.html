<h2>Details</h2>
<p>This post recaps a project I worked on while at Plus One Robotics. <br/>
We had some SSD failures and wanted to get to the root cause, so one test conducted involved testing the effects of sudden power cutoffs. </p>
<h2>System Overview</h2>
<p>I was really into state charts at the time since we were doing some related documentation for other projects. It's really helpful to be able to visualize dataflow and gives you a sens of direction when you get lost in the software sauce. </p>
<p>Here's the one I designed for this system:</p>

<p>To test I designed a Rust based power toggling system of the Rasberry Pi 3 (image below).</p>

</figure>
<p>At the time we were doing separate documentation in Autocad Electrical which  I found to be unintuitive and painful to work with. So I made the above design in Kicad.</p>
<p>The SSDs were placed in an IPC running Ubuntu with a service that did file system corruption testing on a mock file directory.</p>
