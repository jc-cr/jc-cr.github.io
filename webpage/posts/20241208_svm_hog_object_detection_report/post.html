<p>This is a SVM + HOG project I completed for class. <br/>
It performed really bad on the COCO metrics, but had potential to be improved as IoUs after post-processing seem<br/>
to fall within the 0.4 range.</p>

<p>The repository contains the LaTeX build environment for my report and the source code for the project in the<br/>
<a href="/eval_code">eval_code</a> dir.<br/>
The full report can be found in the repository.</p>
<p>The dataset used comes from this paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04590">SH17</a></p>
