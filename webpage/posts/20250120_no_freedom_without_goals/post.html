<p>Freedom is impossible without having goals.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_(disambiguation)">Freedom</a>, generally, is the <strong>ability</strong> or right to change or act without constraint.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ability_(disambiguation)">Ability</a> is the <em>power</em> an agent has to perform <strong>actions</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(philosophy)">Actions</a> are events performed by an agent for a specific purpose or goal.</p>
<p>If you have no goals, you can't perform actions. </p>
<p>But the keyword in ability is actually <em>power</em>. <br/>
Power, however, is defined when the action is defined.<br/>
So we can't even have power without considering some action first.<br/>
But we've stated that no goals exists, therefore no actions exists and no power can be defined. </p>
<p>So you have no ability without goals.</p>
<p>This means that you could have no constraints at all but still lack freedom. </p>
<p>Does this hold in practice (i.e. for someone living in the real world)?<br/>
Not really. <br/>
Some goals appear without us thinking about them.<br/>
For example, the act of breathing is generally a task we don't actively think about but rather an unconscious goal of the body to bring oxygen into the system.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think it's useful to consider this when navigating day-to-day life and planning for the future.<br/>
Personally, I tend to feel the most lost, lonely, and restricted in my path forward when I lose sight or faith in a goal.</p>
<p>Maybe in a future entry we can look at best practices in goal setting.</p>
