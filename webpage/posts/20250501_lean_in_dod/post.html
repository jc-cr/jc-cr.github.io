    <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This report investigates the implementation of lean and six sigma principles within the Department of Defense (DoD) and its affiliated organizations through a scientometric analysis of the literature and then case study analysis of notable works from that search.<br />
Using a structured search methodology across 465 documents from the ProQuest database spanning 1992-2025, the study identifies publication trends, document types, and thematic patterns in lean six sigma literature within defense contexts. <br />
The analysis reveals three predominant themes: Management and Leadership (54\%), Process Improvement (35.9\%), and Continuous Learning (9.2\%).<br />
Case studies from each theme include significant efficiency improvements in depot operations, enhanced contractor relationship management reflecting keiretsu principles, and lean approaches to knowledge management and data accessibility. <br />
Despite the inherent challenges of implementing lean methodologies in bureaucratic defense organizations, this research provides evidence that lean and six sigma principles have been effectively introduced to various aspects of DoD operations, contributing to efficiency, waste reduction, and more effective process management. <br />
These findings suggest that while contextual adaptation is necessary, lean thinking offers valuable frameworks for addressing the DoD's complex operational challenges and resource constraints.</p>
