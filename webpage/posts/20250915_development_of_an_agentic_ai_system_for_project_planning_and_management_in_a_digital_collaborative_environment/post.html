    <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Project management and scheduling are critical challenges in construction and civil engineering, where complex demands in coordination, information management, and task prioritization frequently lead to delays, obstacles, and budget overruns. <br />
Recent advances in agentic artificial intelligence (AI) systems demonstrate significant potential for handling complex decision-making in large-scale collaborative environments. In this pilot study, we developed and evaluated a dual-agent AI system capable of real-time planning and management of human teams in a Minecraft-based structure-building evaluation environment. <br />
A three-person team was evaluated over nine rounds, tasked with replicating template structures in the least amount of time. <br />
For each round, one of three management conditions was used: AI project manager, human project manager, and no project manager oversight. Results indicate that while the No PM condition achieved the fastest overall completion times ($431\pm90s$), the AI PM demonstrated the shortest planning phase ($93\pm22s$) and maintained consistent plan quality scores ($4\pm0$). <br />
These findings provide initial empirical evidence for AI systems' potential in project management roles and offer insights into optimal human-AI collaboration dynamics in digital collaborative environments.<br />
We release the complete agentic framework and Minecraft evaluation environment as open-source software to facilitate future research in AI-assisted project management. </p>
