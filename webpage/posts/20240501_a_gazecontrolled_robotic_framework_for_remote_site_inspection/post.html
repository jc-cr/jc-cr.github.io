    <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rapid and accurate construction inspection is essential to quality control and progress monitoring for timely project delivery. Traditional construction inspection is generally performed manually, which is time-consuming, inconsistent, and labor-intensive. Advances in robot-based inspection using drones and ground robots have shown promise in the field, but there is still a need for skilled operators to make certain decisions in the process. To address this, we propose a gaze-<br />
controlled robotic framework to improve the efficiency of construction inspections. Our framework includes a user interface and a robot software package, which enable user-directed, remote autonomous inspection of objects that are viewable by the robot’s onboard cameras.<br />
Testing of the framework demonstrated that a robot can accurately match the user’s gaze-based targets within just a few seconds of receiving the inspection command. Furthermore, the framework demonstrated high precision, accurately determining the distance from the robot to the object with less than 3% error.</p>
