<h2>Trip summary</h2>
<p>After my internship in Ohio I needed to ride my motorcycle back to Texas. <br/>
Since I was close to the east coast, I figured I might as well take the opportunity to visit some of the beaches.<br/>
So I set my target destination to Key West in Florida and started my trip. <br/>
The image below is rough outline of the entire trip:</p>

<p>I started my trip on 8/16 and reached Key West 8/25. <br/>
On 8/17-8/19, I camped in the Monongahela National Forest doing a 48 hour <a href="https://medicineofone.com/vision-quest/traditional-native-american-vision-quest/">Vision Quest</a>.</p>
<p>I don't have much else to say. <br/>
It started raining a lot after I left Myrtle Beach. <br/>
I almost got stuck in Charleston, SC after a downpour since the streets started flooding.<br/>
Juno beach was really nice. <br/>
The water there was blue and the sand was fine. <br/>
Apparently there was German U-Boat presence near there in WW2 times. </p>
