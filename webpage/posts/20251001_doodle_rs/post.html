<p>Doodle-rs is a project I started while re-familiarizing myself with Rust. <br />
Using an RPi Pico 2W with a small I2C OLED, it renders pixel drawings from a web interface in real-time.<br />
Using networking and async tasks from the Rust <a href="https://embassy.dev/">Embassy framework</a>, the Pico connects to my local WiFi with a static IP address. <br />
The web app connects and establishes a WebSocket connection for low-latency data transfer.<br />
Each pixel update sends a 3-byte message (x, y, state) to the Pico, which immediately updates the OLED display via an async display task.</p>
<p>Here's a live demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/DRKV7F2yQ_g">youtube video</a>.</p>
<p>Not really sure how I'll continue the project from here. <br />
There are some better UI things that could be implemented.<br />
Or I could apply some ML stuff to it. Maybe doing a MNIST guessing game where the user draws a letter and model has to guess what letter it is. </p>
