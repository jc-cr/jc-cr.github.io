<p>Recently I setup the workflow for converting my Obsidian notes to HTML posts for my webpage. </p>
<p>Initially I wanted to do a single, centralized, document that would link to new posts I wanted to make.<br/>
I didn't think that would scale well so instead we (Claude 3.5 and I), setup a script that would generate posts individually on demand. </p>
